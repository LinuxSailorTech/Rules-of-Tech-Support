<h2>OM2 - We the Willing mantra</h2>

<p>We the willing, led by the unknowing<br>
Did the impossible for the ungrateful<br>
We have done so much for so long with so little<br>
That we can now do anything with nothing.</p>

<h1><strong>Feedback</strong></h1>

<hr>

<hr>

<h2>Feedback F1 - Should Rule numbers be in the format of &lt;number&gt; (e.g., Rule 8) and &lt;letter&gt;&lt;number&gt; (e.g., Rule T32)? That is the current system. Or in &lt;xxx&gt; format (e.g., Rule 201)? Rule 1 would stay Rule 1 in either case, though it would also be Rule 100 with the latter.</h2>

<h2>Feedback F2 - Should this list be split into individual posts or stay as one?</h2>

<h2>Feedback F3 - Only contributions from here and that I come up with independently of any other Reddit are here, per this Reddit's copyright policy.</h2>

<h2>Feedback F4 - I will post on the first of each month, conditions permitting, with at least one revised version within a week to address feedback. The version format will be YYYY-MM-DD, including for changelogs. No changelogs on GitHub.</h2>

<h2>Feedback F5 - A set of tech support RPG cards (or a rulebook) would be awesome. Anyone willing to join forces?</h2>

<h2>Feedback F6 - Planning on moving changelogs and links to previous versions to GitHub.</h2>

<h2>Feedback F7 - Suggestions for new sections?</h2>

<h2>Feedback F8 - Should I make changes/additions on GitHub and just post on TFTS the version that is current as of the first day of the month? That would make it easier to see what is new or corrected and still allow people to catch up without having to deal with GitHub.</h2>
