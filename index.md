Feedback
Feedback F1 - Should Rule numbers be in the format of <number> (e.g., Rule 8) and <letter><number> (e.g., Rule T32)? That is the current system. Or in <xxx> format (e.g., Rule 201)? Rule 1 would stay Rule 1 in either case, though it would also be Rule 100 with the latter.
Feedback F2 - Should this list be split into individual posts or stay as one?
Feedback F3 - Only contributions from here and that I come up with independently of any other Reddit are here, per this Reddit's copyright policy.
Feedback F4 - I will post on the first of each month, conditions permitting. The version format will be <month>-<year>.
Feedback F5 - A set of tech support RPG cards (or a rulebook) would be awesome. Anyone willing to join forces?

<h1><strong>Feedback</strong></h1>

<hr/>

<h2><strong>Feedback F1</strong> - Should Rule numbers be in the format of &lt;number&gt; (e.g., Rule 8) and &lt;letter&gt;&lt;number&gt; (e.g., Rule T32)? That is the current system. Or in &lt;xxx&gt; format (e.g., Rule 201)? Rule 1 would stay Rule 1 in either case, though it would also be Rule 100 with the latter.</h2>

<h2><strong>Feedback F2</strong> - Should this list be split into individual posts or stay as one?</h2>

<h2><strong>Feedback F3</strong> - Only contributions from here and that I come up with independently of any other Reddit are here, per this Reddit&#39;s copyright policy.</h2>

<h2><strong>Feedback F4</strong> - I will post on the first of each month, conditions permitting. The version format will be &lt;month&gt;-&lt;year&gt;.</h2>

<h2><strong>Feedback F5</strong> - A set of tech support RPG cards (or a rulebook) would be awesome. Anyone willing to join forces?</h2>
